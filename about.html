        <h2>ðŸŒ± Mulch Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We exist to empower modern city dwellers to reconnect with
          natureâ€”stylishly and sustainably. We design bold, beautiful tools for
          cultivating green spaces in concrete jungles. From rooftop gardens to
          fire escape herbs, we believe gardening is not just a hobbyâ€”itâ€™s a
          lifestyle, an act of resistance, and a way to grow joy. Every MULCH
          tool is crafted with eco-conscious materials, vibrant design, and
          urban life in mind.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          We began in a Brooklyn apartment with more plants than furniture. Our
          founderâ€”an architect by trade and a gardener by soulâ€”was frustrated by
          the lack of stylish, sustainable tools for urban gardening. The only
          options were bland hardware store gear or plastic-heavy kits that
          clashed with the curated vibe of city homes. So they sketched,
          sourced, and prototyped a small set of four tools: a sleek shovel for
          window box repotting, a curved cultivator for container gardens, a
          precise dibber for seeding on tight ledges, and tough shears for
          rooftop jungle trimming. They were functionalâ€”but they also looked
          good. Pastel handles, modern lines, biodegradable finishes. Friends
          wanted them. Then friends of friends. Then strangers on Instagram.
          MULCH grewâ€”organically. Today, weâ€™re a small team of makers, growers,
          and dreamers on a mission to help urbanites build their own patches of
          paradise. No yard? No problem. A balcony, a stoop, a kitchen
          shelfâ€”every inch is fertile ground with the right tools.
